# Golf
A simple game with surprising depth that mixes inspiration from mini-golf and "The World's Hardest Game".

## Objective
Get the ball in the hole with as few strokes you can.

## Controls
### Mouse
Use mouse to aim. Hold left click to increase stroke power reflected by the progress bar in the bottom-left corner. Release to swing (metaphorically). If you would like to cancel your shot before release, hold right mouse button while letting go of the left mouse button before the right (may take some practice).

### Numbers
The numbers 1 through 6 switch to a particular ball type.

1. Normal
2. Bouncy: Impulse applied upon collision.
3. Jumpy: Attempts to teleport forward upon collision (not on edges).
4. Randy: Moves in Brownian motion (randomly). Only works while moving so there is always a chance it will zero its own velocity (thus stopping).
5. Skippy: Moves on water without sinking.
6. Sticky: Stops quickly upon collision. May impliment a stickier version that attaches to moving obstacles.
